## These are provided only as basic examples to build upon when crafting a solution that best fits your environment and needs.

By no means is anything here to be taken as a best practice suggestion. 

#### API access should be highly restricted, if allowed at all. 

##### If you're going to use the Jamf API it is important to take steps to make it as secure as possible. 

I would suggest looking at the API authentication options presented at the link below, by user [macnotes](https://github.com/macnotes/) rather then the methods given in some of these examples.

##### Always test before using, never test in prod, use these at your own risk.
