Too many subreddits to toss on the end of the 'Blogs and Links' page without compromising it's original intent. So, here's the Reddit stuff and some Discord community links.

Still needs cleaning and have to complete the blurbs about each subreddit.

# [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/index.php)
USE THIS FOR ALL ONLINE TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHERS - Search a username and see if they have a reported history of pulling scams.

NOTE: **Just because a name produces no results doesn't mean they're 100% in the clear,** it could just be nobody has taken the time to file a report, or it was never seen because it was 'out of scope' of where The Universal Scammer bot watches transactions.

**However if a name DOES produce a result, the results can speak for themselves.**
