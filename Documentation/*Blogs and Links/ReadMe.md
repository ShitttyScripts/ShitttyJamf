# [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/index.php)
USE THIS FOR ALL ONLINE TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHERS - Search a username and see if they have a reported history of pulling scams. NOTE: **Just because a name produces no results doesn't mean they're 100% in the clear,** it could just be nobody has taken the time to file a report, or it was never seen because it was 'out of scope' of where The Universal Scammer bot watches transactions. **However if a name DOES produce a result, the results can speak for themselves in that case.**

# Discord Communities + Reddit/Subreddit Links Moved

There quickly became too many to add to this page without this one page becoming oveerwhelming. So, I've migrated the Discord Communities List and listing of Subreddits to follow over to it's own page. [Click here to view it on GitHub Pages in pretty HTML and CSS](https://www.gregknackstedt.com/Jamf_things/Documentation/Subreddit_Links/), or, if you want to stick on GitHub [you can view it here instead](https://github.com/scriptsandthings/Jamf_things/tree/master/Documentation/Subreddit_Links). Exact same info, just in different formats.
