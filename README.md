Jamf things

Script for migrating between JSSs when NAC is a pain so you use a 3rd wifi network.

Scripts for add/remove a computer to/from a static group by group ID using Jamf API and bearer token authentication

Default apps thing I don't think works. Needs to be run under the current user context. Could just take it and set the variables as hard coded values and then call it with jamf to accomplish the task most likely. More testing needed.
