# Scripts and Things
A collection of resources for macOS and Jamf pro management to make the lives of sysadmins, engineers, their support staff, and their users a little easier. (Mostly to make my life easier though if we're being real here).

I'm just starting using GitHub to share the things I've found helpful with others since I've benefited from so many other people's GitHub pages and projects over the years; so the organization and stuff here isn't great yet and probably won't be for a while..... I rather add a bunch of useful (working) things so I don't forget to save them somewhere and lose them eventually, then spend time messing with markdown to make this README.md look good (also note to self: need to get a markdown editor w/spellcheck).
