# Jamf Things
Stuff I've created for use within Jamf Pro to make my life, the lives of our users, and the lives of our support staff a little easier. (Mostly to make my life easier though if we're being real here).

I'm just starting using GitHub to save some of my work to share the things I've found helpful with others since I've benifited from so many other people's GitHub pages and projects over the years; so the orginization and stuff here isn't great yet and probably won't be for a while..... I rather add a bunch of useful (working) things so I don't forget to save them somewhere and lose them eventually, then spend time messing with markdown to make this README.me look good.
